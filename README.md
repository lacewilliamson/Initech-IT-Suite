# Initech IT Suite #

This suite is a parody creation of a 1980's themed "unfinished" IT interface from the fictional company _Initech_, featured in the film _Office Space_. 

## Features

- A traditional 80's style command line interface
    - Login Screen
    - Initech Super String Searcher


- Planned Features
    - Employee Tracker
    - Initech Company Trivia

Tongue in cheek "debug" statements are still printed to the console throughout the code, from the voice of the developer creating this system for Initech. Examples:

 - "Tell Jake he's an idiot for giving users a method to change their own salary, accounting is ticked. FIX THIS."

 - "TPS Reports are the bane of my existence. TODO: Create a digitized tracking system for same."

 - "New guy Will Lumbergh couldn't remember login, had to change password 6 times. It's now "x". Definitely upper management material."
  
**Additional features welcome. Contact me and I'll add them to the wishlist below, or clone the repo and get started on your own today!**

## Background 
During the course of Tech Elevator Cohort 14, comedic _Office Space_ references were daily occurrences. 

One of the homework assignments near the end of the C# module had us writing a simple user interface to accept a path and string from a user, so that the file at the passed path could be parsed for instances of that string, ultimately returning to the user the line number and contents when a match was found. 

I went a little overboard and themed the "UI" out of boredom, creating the "Initech Super String Searcher". I had such a good time working/playing with it that the parody _Initech IT Suite_ idea grew organically from wanting to do more _Office Space_ themed development.

This is also mildly inspired by the fun interactive consoles hidden in the early _Matrix_ console games, and the original _Call of Duty Black Ops_.

## Usage
Download and run the executable file on any Windows machine with the appropriate .NET frameworks. If you want to build from source, feel free.
